# src/ — Worker source

Module boundaries are strict; respect them when editing:

| File | Role | Boundary rule |
|------|------|---------------|
| `invariants.ts` | The five domain invariants + `normalizeCampaign` | **Pure. Zero I/O, zero imports from client/tools/mcp.** External facts (rates, ages, MO planet set) arrive via `NormalizeContext`. |
| `client.ts` | Upstream fetch + KV cache + rate sampling | Owns the `hp_per_hour` sign convention (comment block) and all KV access. |
| `connectivity.ts` | Waypoint degree + deterministic neighbor join | **Pure. Zero I/O.** Enriches facts only — never routing/reachability/targeting conclusions. |
| `tools.ts` | The five tool implementations | Orchestration only: fetch → assemble context → call pure normalization/enrichment. |
| `mcp.ts` | JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol | No domain logic. Domain errors become `isError` tool results, never raw exceptions. |
| `types.ts` | Raw upstream + normalized types | Types only. |
| `index.ts` | Entry/routing | POST `/` or `/mcp` only. |

## The five invariants (do not weaken)

1. **Defense decay is cosmetic → force-null** (`nullifyDefenseDecay`), even
   when upstream sends a real-looking `regenPerSecond`.
2. **Liberation % is NOT raw HP** — exists only as
   `liberation_pct_display_only`; never used in any math.
3. **Projections = `raw_hp / abs(hp_per_hour)`** (`projectResolution`), never
   from % progress. `hp_per_hour === 0` → `status: "stalemate"`, null hours —
   never divide by zero. Missing HP → `data_error`, never substitute 0.
4. **Ramp-up stabilization**: campaigns younger than `RAMP_UP_THRESHOLD_MS`
   (1h) get `stabilizing: true` and suppressed alerts. Unknown age = young
   (fail-safe).
5. **HPC decay is intentionally deceptive**: HPCs never emit collapse alerts.
   HPC = `HPC_CAMPAIGN_TYPES.has(type) || moPlanetIndices.has(planetIndex)`.
   When in doubt, classify AS HPC — over-inclusion is fail-safe.

Invariant order in `normalizeCampaign`: data-quality gate → direction/alert →
invariant 4 → invariant 5 → projection.

## hp_per_hour sign convention (single source of truth)

Defined ONCE in the comment block above `samplePlanetRates` in `client.ts`.
Health counts DOWN toward resolution:

- `hp_per_hour = (previous.health − current.health) / hoursElapsed`
- positive → health depleting → progressing; negative → health rising → losing

One signed value, consumed in exactly two places: `projectResolution` takes
its **magnitude** (`abs`, deliberately sign-blind) and `directionFromRate`
takes its **sign** — `direction` is the SOLE carrier of liberating-vs-losing.
Never derive direction from a second, independently computed quantity, and
never let the convention drift between liberation and defense campaigns
(defense samples `event.health`, same formula).

## Caching rule

KV (`WAR_CACHE`) stores **RAW** upstream responses; normalization always runs
AFTER the cache read, so invariant changes never require cache invalidation.
Rate samples only update when ≥60s apart (`MIN_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_MS`) — closer
reads reuse `lastRate` so cached health doesn't collapse the rate to a bogus 0.
On upstream 429/5xx/timeout: serve the stale KV copy with `stale: true`, else
throw `UpstreamError` (which `mcp.ts` turns into a structured tool error).
